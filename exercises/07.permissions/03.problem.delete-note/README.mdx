# Delete Note

ü¶â Adding a permissions model to an application requires quite a bit of extra work.
It's possible you could build in this permissions model into the prisma client
via [prisma client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions)
which would drastically simplify the amount of work necessary. For example, you
could do something like this:

```tsx
export function action(request) {
	const client = prisma.$extend(getUserPrisma(request))
}
```

And then the client would honor the permissions. If you're interested in
building this out, please give it a shot and let us know how it goes!

That said, there are some handy utilities we can make to make this easier. We'll
get to those in the next step.

üë®‚Äçüíº For now, we're going to have to do this integration manually. And we'll start
with something simple: deleting notes.

We need to adjust our code to support owners deleting their own notes if they
have permission, and also allow admins to delete any note.
