# Set the userId

👨‍💼 Great! Now our server can determine who the user is just by inspecting the
request's `cookie` header. Let's do that next.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to do a little work in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> to make
a nicer UI for the user once they're logged in. You'll still need to wire it up
in the next step, but if you'd like to see what I'm
doing, <DiffLink app1={0} app2={1} preview>check out the diff</DiffLink>.
