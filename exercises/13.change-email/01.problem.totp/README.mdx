# Generate TOTP

👨‍💼 Alrighty, first you're going to need to add a `'change-email'` verification
type and call the `handleVerification` for that verification type. Of course,
Kellie's 🧝‍♂️ left the actual implementation of the `change-email`
`handleVerification` to you (you'll do that in the next step though). Oh, and
you're also going to need to handle actually preparing the verification as well.
All similar to stuff you've done before, so I'll leave you to it!

The one unique thing about this is in the implementation of `handleVerification`
in the next step. See you there!
