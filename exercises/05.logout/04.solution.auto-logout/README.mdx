👨‍💼 Well, that was fun. Our app doesn't really need this so... Kellie? Can you
get rid of this?

🧝‍♂️ I'll take care of it 😈

more utilities and refactor some of the code. I'll take care of this while I'm
at it.

As always, you
can <DiffLink app1={0} app2={1} preview>review my changes</DiffLink> if you're
curious. I'm not changing functionality. Just moving some things around.
