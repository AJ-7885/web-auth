# Verify 2FA Code

We're going to continue the flow from the previous exercise. Here's an expanded
diagram from where we left off:

We left off at the point where the verification is upgraded to a legit 2FA
verification. From there we have the following flow:

- The user logs out (eventually)
- The server unsets the session ID (we do all this already)
- The user logs back in
- The server checks that the 2FA verification exists
- The server still create their managed session, but instead of the main
  `cookieSession`, we put it in the `verifySession` and send them to the
  `/verify` route.
- The user submits the 2FA code generated by their app
- The server verifies the code
- The server moves their session from the `verifySession` to the
  regular `cookieSession`.
