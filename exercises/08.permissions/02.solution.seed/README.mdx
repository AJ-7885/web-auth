# Roles Seed

👨‍💼 Great, now we can start using this data in our UI to control who gets to do
what. Let's start simple though...

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to add a bit of logic for the UI. So if the user doesn't have the
permission to do something, we'll just hide the button. That way you can focus
on securing things on the backend.

Feel free to <DiffLink app1={0} app2={1} preview>check out the diff</DiffLink>
if you would like.
