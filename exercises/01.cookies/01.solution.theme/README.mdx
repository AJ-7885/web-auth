# Theme Cookie

👨‍💼 Great job! That's pretty low-level cookie management, but it's perfect

🦉 One optimization we could possibly make is to change the cookie on the client
and trigger a manual state update. But the benefit of the way we have it here is
we can completely change the data that comes back based on the value of the
cookie and if we applied that optimization we'd need to revalidate the data
anyway.

So we won't be making that optimization for two reasons:

1. It limits our capabilities
2. Users don't change their theme very often anyway, so it's really unnecessary.

That said, the theme won't actually change until the network request to change
it finishes. So applying optimistic UI to this change would be really useful.
That's outside the scope of this workshop on authentication though so we'll
leave that to you if you'd like to implement that.
