# Roles Seed

👨‍💼 Perhaps in the future we'll want pretty fine-grained roles and permissions,
but for now we really only have two roles:

1. `admin` - which can do anything to everything
2. `user` - which can do anything to their own data

Our <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts" /> script should create these roles and
permissions, and assign the "user" roles to the generated users and the "admin"
role to the `Kody` user.

Once you've finished updating the seed script, run it with:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```
