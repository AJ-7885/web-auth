# Pass Redirect URL

👨‍💼 So far so good.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to
implement <InlineFile file="app/utils/redirect-cookie.server.ts" /> which will
`export` a `getRedirectCookieHeader` and `getRedirectCookieValue` function as
well as a `destroyRedirectToHeader` value. Feel free to do that yourself, or
just <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink>. It's nothing you've not done already,
but it could be good practice if you want to do it yourself.
