# Logout

👨‍💼 We've got a logout button on the user profile page when the user's logged in
and looking at their own profile (like if Kody goes to <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" />).
But right now it doesn't do anything. Let's make it post to the `/logout` route
and make the `/logout` `action` clear the user's `userId` from the session.

🦉 (psst, don't forget the "files" menu below).
