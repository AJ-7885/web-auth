# Verification

When a user wants to sign up for an account on your application, and you want to
make sure they provide some way to contact them, it's a good idea to verify they
actually are the owner of the contact information. It would be a problem if I
signed up for [ùïè](https://x.com) with the email address of joe@whitehouse.gov,
and then used that to impersonate the president.

Verification also helps you to reduce the number of spam accounts made on your
site, since you can require that a user verify their email address before they
can use it.

Finally, it reduces the number of typos that users make when entering their
contact information. If you require that a user verify their email address
before they can use it, then you (and they) can be sure that they entered it
correctly.

But how you go about verifying the user's information is important. You need to
make sure the only way to verify the information is if the user _actually_ has
access to it. This means you want to use a mechanism where making good or many
guesses is difficult, and where the user can't be tricked into giving away the
verification information.

## Verification Codes

There are a few different approaches to verification, each with their own
advantages and disadvantages. But most verification approaches involve sending
the user a message with a code, and then asking them to enter that code into
your application. For the code itself, you have options, but most prefer to send
a short code that the user could easily enter in manually if they have to.
Normally a six digit number is sufficient.

However, because this code is so short, there are only 999999 possible codes.
Which may seem like a lot, but for a brute-force attack it's not at all. For
this reason, it's important that you limit the number of guesses a user can make
in a given time period to make it unfeasible to guess the code. This is called
[rate limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/),
and it's important to do this for all verification codes.

	In fact, rate limiting is an important part of any public API, especially for
	authentication (login, sign up, and verification). However, it is outside the
	scope of this workshop.
