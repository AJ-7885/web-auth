# Provider Callback

When you authenticate with a third party, you have several scenarios you need to
consider:

- Logged in & already connected -> Error
- Logged in & connected to someone else -> Error
- New Connection & not logged in -> Connect, send to onboarding
- New Connection & logged in -> Connect, send to connections page
- New Connection & matches existing user -> Connect, login, send to connections
