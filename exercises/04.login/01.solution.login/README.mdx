# Login

üë®‚Äçüíº Stellar! Now we can really be sure the user is who they say they are when
they log in. Next, let's add some utilities that will make it much easier to
access the user's information throughout our UI from anywhere in the app.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm going to make a few changes for you to help you focus on your task,
specifically, I'm going to:

1. add a (non-functional) logout button to the user's page if they're looking
   at their own profile.
1. Only display the note delete and edit buttons if the user is the owner of the
   note.
1. Only display an "add note" link if the user's looking at their own notes.

None of these will be wired up (that's your job), but they'll help you see what
you're working towards. And it's important to note that just because we don't
display the UI for something, doesn't mean the user can't do that with
sophisticated tools so we'll definitely want to add some logic on the backend
too. We'll get to that later though.

As always, if you want to, you
