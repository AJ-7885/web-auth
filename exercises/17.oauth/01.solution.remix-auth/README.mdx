# Remix Auth

👨‍💼 Great, we've got Remix Auth all set up. Let's get on with the auth flow.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to set up the routes for the auth flow:

- `/auth/github` - the `action` that handles when the user clicks
  "Login with GitHub"
- `/auth/github/callback` - the `loader` that handles when the user authorizes
  GitHub.

Feel free to <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink> or try it out yourself if you
want the extra practice.
