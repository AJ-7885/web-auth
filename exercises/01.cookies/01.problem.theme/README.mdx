# Theme Cookie

👨‍💼 To get started with cookies in our application, we're going to start with
something a little lighter weight than authentication: Theme Preference.

We want the user to be able to choose between light and dark mode. Our
application is already set up to handle this via a class name on the `<html>`
element (put `light` or `dark` in the class name and the UI will update through
the magic of CSS Custom Properties + Tailwind).

🧝‍♂️ I've already wired up most things, (check the action, `ThemeSwitch` and
`Document` in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" line="95" />). So all you need to
do is finish the implementation of <InlineFile file="app/utils/theme.server.ts" />
and then finish wiring things up in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />.

👨‍💼 When you've finished, you should be able to click the icon in the bottom
right to update the theme. You'll notice a network request each time you click
it so the server can update the cookie. You should see the `set-cookie` header
