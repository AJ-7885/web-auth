# 🔐 Web Authentication

👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the day. We're going to have you
working on authentication for the Epic Notes app today.

So far any user can edit all the notes, even if they're not logged in! Obviously
we need to give users an opportunity to create accounts and then lock down their
data to their account. Throughout the workshop, you'll learn important
foundational skills of full stack development like:

1. Storing user preferences in cookies
2. Using cookies to identify users
3. Managing and safely storing passwords
4. Securely validating passwords
5. Managing logout and session expiration
6. Locking down UI and backend routes
7. Support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
8. Support server-managed sessions

It's a big job and there's lots to do, so, let's get started!
